# 🧱 CS112L – Object-Oriented Programming in C++  
*Lab Repository for C++ OOP Concepts and Practical Code*

---

## 📁 Folder Overview

This repository contains practical C++ code examples from the CS112L course, focused on core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. Each topic is organized into its own subfolder for clarity and ease of use.
**Navigation**: Go to the folder titled, 'OOP Related Topics', and within that, you will find folders divided according to topics, and within them, the codes.

## 📌 Topics Covered

- ✅ **Operator Overloading**  
  Demonstrates how to overload operators (e.g., `+`, `==`, `<<`) for user-defined classes

- ✅ **Type Casting**  
  Covers static, dynamic, and user-defined type conversions between classes and built-in types

- ✅ **Overridden Functions**  
  Showcases method overriding and polymorphism in inheritance hierarchies [`Abstract Classes` and `Pure virtual functions`]

## 💡 Purpose
I have made this repo to save all the codes that I wrote in our CS112L. This includes the lab tasks that were assigned, and additionally, the practice I did of each topic, in order to better cement my concepts and syntax.

The repo is built to:
- Reinforce core OOP principles in C++ through real code
- Serve as a reference base for lab assignments and future projects
- Provide a well-organized structure for reviewing key C++ topics



Again, the purpose of this is just like any other: *to hopefully help all those who might be taking up such a Lab course in the future.*

## 📘 More to Come
Additional folders and codes will be added, as time passes.

As always, I am open to contributions.
